## Overview

Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is an increasing popular category of crowdsourcing in the era of mobile Internet and sharing economy, where tasks are spatio-temporal (belonging to both space and time or to space-time) and must be completed at a specific location and time. It is a matching problem that matches people with certain skills to those that need those skills based on their location. While this may seem simple at first glance, as more variables are considered it becomes exponentially more complex.
