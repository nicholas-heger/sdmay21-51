# [Constrained Re-Planning in Spatial Crowdsourcing](https://sdmay21-51.sd.ece.iastate.edu/)

## Overview

- Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is an increasing popular category of crowdsourcing in the era of mobile Internet and
  sharing economy, where tasks are spatio-temporal (belonging to both space and time or to space-time) and must be
  completed at a specific location and time. It is a matching problem that matches people with certain skills to those
  that need those skills based on their location. While this may seem simple at first glance, as more variables are
  considered it becomes exponentially more complex.
